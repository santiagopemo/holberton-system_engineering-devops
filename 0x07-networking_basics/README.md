## Learning Objectives :bulb:
* At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

### OSI Model
* What it is
* How many layers it has
* How it is organized
### What is a LAN
* Typical usage
* Typical geographical size
### What is a WAN
* Typical usage
* Typical geographical size
### What is the Internet
* What is an IP address
* What are the 2 types of IP address
* What is localhost
* What is a subnet
* Why IPv6 was created
### TCP/UDP
* What are the 2 mainly used data transfer protocols for IP (transfer level on the OSI schema)
* What is the main difference between TCP and UDP
* What is a port
* Memorize SSH, HTTP and HTTPS port numbers
* What tool/protocol is often used to check if a device is connected to a network
## Requirements :white_check_mark:
### General
* Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
* All your Bash script files will be interpreted on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
* All your files should end with a new line
* A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
* All your Bash script files must be executable
* Your Bash script must pass shellcheck without any error
* The first line of all your Bash scripts should be exactly #!/usr/bin/env bash
* The second line of all your Bash scripts should be a comment explaining what is the script doing

## Tasks
### Mandatory :page_with_curl:
- [x] **[0. OSI model](./0-OSI_model)** - OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) is an abstract model to describe layered communication and computer network design. The idea is to segregate the different parts of what make communication possible
- [x] **[1. Types of network](./1-types_of_network)** - LAN connect local devices together, WAN connects LANs together, and WANs are operating over the Internet
- [x] **[2. MAC and IP address](./2-MAC_and_IP_address)** - Questions
- [x] **[3. UDP and TCP](./3-UDP_and_TCP)** - Let’s fill the empty parts in the drawing above
- [x] **[4. TCP and UDP ports](./4-TCP_and_UDP_ports)** - Once packets have been sent to the right network device using IP using either UDP or TCP as a mode of transportation, it needs to actually enter the network device
- [x] **[5. Is the host on the network](./5-is_the_host_on_the_network)** - Write a Bash script that pings an IP address passed as an argument.
