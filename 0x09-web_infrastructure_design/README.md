# 0x09. Web infrastructure design
## Resources :books:
### Read or watch:



* [Network basics]()
* [Server]()
* [Web server]()
* [DNS]()
* [Load balancer]()
* [Monitoring]()
* [What is a database]()
* [What’s the difference between a web server and an app server?]()
* [DNS record types]()
* [Single point of failure]()
* [How to avoid downtime when deploying new code]()
* [High availability cluster (active-active/active-passive)]()
* [What is HTTPS]()
* [What is a firewall]()
## Learning Objectives :bulb:
* At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

### General
* You must be able to draw a diagram covering the web stack you built with the sysadmin/devops track projects
* You must be able to explain what each component is doing
* You must be able to explain system redundancy
* Know all the mentioned acronyms: LAMP, SPOF, QPS
## Requirements :white_check_mark:
### General
* A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
* For each task, once you are done whiteboarding (on a whiteboard, piece of paper or software or your choice), take a picture/screenshot of your diagram
* This project will be manually reviewed:
* As each task is completed, the name of that task will turn green
* Upload a screenshot, showing that you completed the required levels, to any image hosting service (I personally use imgur but feel free to use anything you want).
* For the following tasks, insert the link from of your screenshot into the answer file
* After pushing your answer file to Github, insert the Github file link into the URL box
* You will also have to whiteboard each task in front of a mentor, staff or student - no computer or notes will be allowed during the whiteboarding session
* Focus on what you are being asked:
* Cover what the requirements mention, we will explore details in a later project
* Keep in mind that you will have 30 minutes to perform the exercise, you will get points for what is asked in requirements
* Similarly in a job interview, you should answer what the interviewer asked for, be careful about being too verbose - always ask the interviewer if going into details is necessary - speaking too much can play against you
* In this project, again, avoid going in details if not asked
## Tasks
### Mandatory :page_with_curl:
- [x] **[0. Simple web stack](./0-simple_web_stack)** - A lot of websites are powered by simple web infrastructure, a lot of time it is composed of a single server with a LAMP stack
- [x] **[1. Distributed web infrastructure](./1-distributed_web_infrastructure)** - On a whiteboard, design a three server web infrastructure that hosts the website www.foobar.com
- [x] **[2. Secured and monitored web infrastructure](./2-secured_and_monitored_web_infrastructure)** - On a whiteboard, design a three server web infrastructure that hosts the website www.foobar.com, it must be secured, serve encrypted traffic, and be monitored
### Advance :muscle:
- [x] **[3. Scale up](./3-scale_up)** - Application server vs web server
